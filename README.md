# Cricket-Game

The beloved middle-school game comes into code! The first simple version in C, more real-life cricket features coming in bits and pieces in C++ and Python. Lots in plans, maybe even a Machine Learning algorithm to predict the score?

The C++ version coming in bits and pieces, so far, a display of two random functions (the rand and the mt19337 engine 'playing' against each other)... hoping to achieve a lot more before compiling all together a single unit.
-> Multiplayer Mode

-> Random Name generator for the players

-> File Systems to record the playing of the game

-> Real time analysis of scores and predicting systems (ML of sorts)

-> GUI interface (Vulkan, Java XML, Python, etcetra) and more

And also maybe a machine learning algorithm to predict Adeep's next moves!.
 
C Version done, C++, Java, Python and new upcoming in Rust also!

C Version with a few bugs, will be sorted. 

C++ version few objectives passed, but will be done.

Java, Python and Rust version to start very soon!

C# ASP.NET version..? Let's see!
