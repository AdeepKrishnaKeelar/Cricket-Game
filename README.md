This is the childhood hand-cricket game most of the students played, probably in their middle school (I used to play this even in high-school) 
The basic versions of this lovable game is implemented using C. Decided to enhance the possibilities by bringing in more features similar to real-cricket using C++ and Python. 
Lot of plans in mind, will be updating this regularly I hope
